This program analyzes the frequency and sequencing of words in sentences in samples of English text. Then it
generates new sequences of strings that mimic these statistics and present these sequences as computer-generated text. 
The key idea is that if particular words often appear together in the sample text, then it is likely that stringing 
together these common pairs of words will form plausible phrases or sentences. This statistical model is called a Markov 
chain.
