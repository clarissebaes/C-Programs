EXPLANATION OF REMOVING PASSENGERS FROM UPGRADE LIST:
I had 2 string vectors, one for upgrades to business and one for upgrades to first. When I called my 
cxl function, I pass through my command vector(that has the passenger id of the person requesting a cancel), the 2
upgrade vectors. Then I iterated through both upgrade list, if the pass id is found in the upgrade list, I redefined that index
as "NO". Then when I printed my upgrade list I had an if statement that checks if the passenger name is "NO". If its "NO" then it
doesnt print it.
